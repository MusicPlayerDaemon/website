MPD is designed around a client/server architecture, where the clients
and server (MPD is the server) interact over a network.  Thus, running
MPD is only half of the equation.  To use MPD, you need to install a
MPD client (aka MPD interface).

This is an (incomplete) list of free and open source MPD clients.
