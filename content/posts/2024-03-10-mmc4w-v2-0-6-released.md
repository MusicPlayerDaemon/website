**MMC4W** The Minimal MPD Client for Windows [v2.0.6](https://github.com/drgerg/mmc4w/tree/main) is now available.

New improved Playlist Builder Mode. Better searching, saving of window sizes and positions. 

MMC4W.py now also runs in Linux without modification.  I've tested it under Ubuntu and Mint.

More details in the [help](https://github.com/drgerg/mmc4w/blob/main/code/mmc4w_help.md) and [README.txt](https://github.com/drgerg/mmc4w/blob/main/code/README.txt).
