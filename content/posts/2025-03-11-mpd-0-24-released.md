**Music Player Daemon** [0.24](/download/mpd/0.24/mpd-0.24.tar.xz) has
been released.

This took more than three years (sorry for the long delay), and in
these years, many many new features have accumulated: better
multi-channel support, improved partitions, many new protocol
features, NFS4 support, ...

[Change log](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MusicPlayerDaemon/MPD/v0.24/NEWS)

On the development side, MPD has switched to C++20 and thus needs a
modern compiler (e.g. GCC 12).  The dependency on Boost was removed,
good riddance!

Support for the Haiku operating system was removed because there was
no maintainer.  macOS support got removed temporarily, but was brought
back by a new maintainer (thanks, [Camille
Scholtz](https://github.com/CamilleScholtz)).  The Android port is
still there, but hasn't received enough attention to make it really
usable.

Since MPD 0.23, there were 2397 commits by 72 contributors.

There is no shortage of ideas for MPD 0.25, and unfortunately there
are too many open bug reports.  I'll try to finish MPD 0.25 faster
than 0.24, but time constraints are still difficult for
[me](https://github.com/MaxKellermann/).  My orignal idea was to
finish MPD 1.0 for its 20th anniversary, but we're already two years
past that...  and the code still feels not mature enough to call it
1.0.  Maybe in 2028, for MPD's 25th anniversary?
